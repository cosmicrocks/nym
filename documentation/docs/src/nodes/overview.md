> This section was previously the node setup guides. These have been migrated to their own [**Operator Guides**](https://nymtech.net/operators) book. 
> 
> For setup and maintenance guides, go to the Operators book linked above. 
> 
> This section is a little spartan for the moment, but we will be adding detailed information about how exactly each node functions, as well as references to any literature and technical specs in the near future. 

This section contains information on the different node types of the mixnet and blockchain.
